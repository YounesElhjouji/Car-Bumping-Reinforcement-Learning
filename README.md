Simple car-bumping game made to test different reinforcement learning algorithms and to introduce me to curiosity-driven learning as well as compare it to older algorithms ad models.

Python and Pyglet are used to make the game and the reinforcement learning algorithms are to be programmed from scratch in Python.
I prefer coding the RL algorithms from scratch to familiarize myself with the basics and the logic as well as to have full control and ability to tweak any aspect of the algorithms once they are running.
